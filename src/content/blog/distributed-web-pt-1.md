As a business, your goal is basically two-fold: provide a product or service, and raise awareness of
that product/service.

Most business websites exist for the latter reason: _raising awareness_. So unless an online
component is at the very core of your business, you don’t need your own custom website. At least not
before you’ve taken full advantage of existing channels.

## The Cost of Custom

Not convinced you don’t need a website? Consider the following:

### **1. Custom is an inconvenience**

How many times have you visited an actor’s or actress’s personal site to see what movies they were
in, rather than _IMDB_? Never, right? There’s something wonderful about the consistency of a service
we’re familiar with, like _IMDB_. It guarantees us the information we seek while sparing us the
potential horror of navigating someone’s
[personal site](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kdries/29-poor-excuses-for-celebrity-websites-4fsn).

Users won’t visit your website more than once unless it is _really_ worth their time.

### **2. Custom is expensive**

The average WordPress site can cost
[$14k according to one article’s estimation](https://codeable.io/how-much-does-a-wordpress-site-really-cost/).
While I know many sites are developed cheaper (separate discussion), we’re talking about
professional, USA-grade quality here. Is there a definite need for you to spend $14k on a website if
an existing service would serve the same purpose?

Absolutely not.

### **3. Custom isn’t discoverable**

Just because you build it [doesn’t mean they will come](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227850).
How many times have you ever eaten at a restaurant by Googling _restaurant in [city I’m in]_?
Probably never. Why? Because it’s a huge waste of time digging through bad restaurant websites, and
it doesn’t even guarantee you’ll find what you’re looking for because the chances of an amazing dim
sum place investing in SEO are pretty slim. Chances are you’re going to use _Yelp_, _Foursquare_,
_Google_, or your favorite food blog for recommendations instead. The only time you’ll realistically
go to a restaurant site is if you’ve already discovered it, are making the decision to eat there,
and only want the menu/hours—assuming it even _exists_.

The bottom line: **custom sites are for people that already know about you**; they don’t expose your
business to new users like _Facebook, Yelp,_ and _Google_ do.

## What to do instead

So instead of building that fancy custom website that costs time and money with no real benefit, try
doing this first:

1. Making [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business),
   [Google](https://business.google.com/add?service=plus), and [Yelp](https://biz.yelp.com/)
   listings with all your correct info
1. Need a blog? Try [Medium](https://medium.com/)
1. Photographer or Videographer? Try [Instagram](https://instagram.com/),
   [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), and [500px](https://portfolios.500px.com/)
1. Artist? Get on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
1. Need a podcast? Try [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
1. Need to sell something? Try [Shopify](https://shopify.com/) or [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)
1. Make your own product? Try [Etsy](https://etsy.com/), [Society6](https://society6.com/), or
   [Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/)
1. Educator? Check out [Skillshare](https://skillshare.com/teach), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/),
   and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative/all)

_This is all great — I know there are a lot of services that do what I need to in small pieces, but
how do I tie it all together? Don’t I need a website so people can see all the links together?_

Not really.

Sure, using existing services doesn’t fill in _all_ the gaps. But take into account that these
services combined have _billions_ of existing users, along with discovery channels for new users to
find you. Your custom website, by comparison, starts out at _zero_ users. And unless you’ve invested
a _lot_ of money into your custom site, it still probably doesn’t do a fraction of what these
services provide _for free_.

Now, there may very well be a need, after you’ve tried everything under the sun, for your very
unique problem. But at least now you _know_ what you need, instead of merely _thinking_ you needed
it.
