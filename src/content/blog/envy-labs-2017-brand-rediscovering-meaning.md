# What’s a “brand?”

Michael Beirut, Principle at Pentagram, spelled it out a few years ago:
[graphic design criticism is a spectator sport](http://designobserver.com/feature/graphic-design-criticism-as-a-spectator-sport/37607/).
But I’d argue since that 2013 essay, it’s risen past mere “spectator sport” to the realm of casual
dinner conversation. Today, it’s not unusual to overhear a coffee shop conversation with someone
talking about their “personal” or “lifestyle” brand on Instagram. And it’s only becoming more
embedded in our culture. For the most part, we’re all aware of it, and fine with it.

A brand often starts with a logo. This we all know. It doesn’t have to end there—a brand in its pure
form is, after all, an eternal idea or movement—but slapping symbols on everything is a habit we
can’t kick. No matter how lofty or eternal your vision is, society still needs that symbol or
wordmark to legitimize it. Technology isn’t helping us break our addiction, either. Starting a
business? You’d better have a logo. Starting a Facebook group? You need an avatar and header
graphic! Made a website? Upload a logo and favicon to get started! Working at a company that still
has an ’80s logo? Adapt or die! Rebrand, refresh. Rebrand, refresh.

We fell into this trap with our last _Envy_ logo update from 2013, when we updated an over-stylized
logo that dated us. We “refreshed our brand” to feel more relevant. It worked. But when it came time
for us to “refresh” again, we didn’t want to do it out of pure habit. We didn’t want to neglect the
one central reason you even call it a “brand.” And that’s _meaning_.

A brand consisting of a logo, and nothing more, is shallow and somewhat pointless.

For most of Envy Labs’ history, we’ve been guilty of prioritizing our clients’ needs above our own.
We’re not serial promoters; we neglect our “brand” almost by default. Enough time had passed since
our last company orienteering, where we needed a reminder of what we stand for, and the big picture
of what we’re accomplishing.

To rebrand is to revisit your values—the \_raisons d’être—\_organize them, and invite outsiders into
what you’re setting out to accomplish. A brand is more than a mere company or a part of capitalism.
A true brand is an idea or movement, something much grander and more important than money. It can
take the form of a company, but it doesn’t have to. A brand is merely an idea that people can agree
or disagree with.

We needed to rediscover our meaning.

# Started from the bottom, now we’re…where, exactly?

The name _Envy Labs_ came about in 2008 when Gregg Pollack started a full-time web agency with three
other developers after his popular
[_Rails Envy_ podcast/blogging venture](http://jasonseifer.com/2010/04/08/rails-envy) with Jason
Seifer. _Rails Envy_ was a tongue-in-cheek reference to non-Rails developers’ being envious of Rails
developers’ amazing experience building web software (which, in 2007, was mostly true based on what
the rest of the landscape looked like).

Touching on that same vein, Gregg came up with the name _Envy Labs_ because it sought to create the
same culture that so many other agencies had achieved. Beautiful, downtown office spaces. Remote
work. Unlimited vacation. Ridiculous benefits. Incredible company culture. Gregg wanted to start a
company that took care of people well—one that others were _envious_ of.

In a mere four-and-some-change short years, Envy Labs had grown, and now had a successful
bootstrapped product on its hands: [_Code School_](https://www.codeschool.com/). The combined number
of employees were somewhere in the 40–50 range, and the company was able to provide some of the best
salary, benefits, culture, and growth opportunities for a tech company in the state of Florida. It
attracted some of the most passionate, driven, fun-loving individuals you could hope to find.

Everything was great. Magical, even.

But how far can “be better than the rest” take you? Where do you go from there once you’ve achieved
the success you’re going for?

Rather than take some time out for self-reflection, we pushed on, continuing to focus on making our
company culture bigger and better. Often to the neglect of what we were achieving beyond our four
walls.

# Where do we go from here?

and I—sat down to assess our current company vision. We had officially parted ways with Code School,
cemented by the
[sale in Jan 2015](https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/online-learning-service-pluralsight-acquires-code-school-for-36-million/).
We left the shared office in May 2016, returning to our numbers to sub-twenty. In many ways, 2016
closed a seminal chapter in Envy’s history, giving way to a brand new one. What were we
accomplishing? What were we targeting? If our company was a vessel, where were we sailing it?

The design team began by finding our brand positioning—our place in the (economic) universe. Where
did we fit in? Did our name reflect that? Over the course of months, we explored
[_evocative names_](https://www.zinzin.com/process/name-development/evocative-names/) that captured
the spirit of what we were seeking after.

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UUseCAjDstSDlfY4dKzWJw.jpeg"><figcaption>To discover our brand positioning, we mapped out leaders in our industry as well as explored potential names for us to find our own niche. We may have re-discovered an IP or two in the process.</figcaption></figure>

We needed to communicate several things:

1. We liked solving impossible problems.
1. We moved fast, and could outpace many larger agencies in building scalable web apps in a matter
   of weeks.
1. We were small and nimble, able to spin up or down quickly, and able to fit into nearly any
   existing corporate structure.

For the better part of our exploration, we felt we had outgrown the word “_Envy_.” We felt that word
stood for something that was no longer part of who we were, or where we wanted to go.

After all, how can you build a vision for the future based on what somebody else has?

We explored many potential names, trying each out over the course of weeks. In the office, we even
pretended we had already changed our name. Some company names were rejected in less than a day.
Other names we _really_ liked, and would have probably changed our name to had we not discovered a
few similar trademarks after coming up with the name.

# A Return to Form

Months of crumpled paper, erased whiteboards, and `-final-final-v3.ai` Illustrator documents turned
up nothing but dead ends in the search for this new identity.

We were discouraged. After some soul-searching, we still couldn’t find the right words that captured
who we needed to be. Unsure where to sail toward, we returned to our roots—that initial spark—that
exploded into the vibrant culture and history we wanted to preserve.

But more than that: we couldn’t forge ahead marching to the beat of our own drum. We achieved
success because we had solved others’ problems, and would continue to do so as long as the company
existed. We didn’t exist without others. So, we took one step back in order to take two steps
forward:

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*CQtyJKwOLs66rcdcHprCCw.gif?q=20"><figcaption>A throwback, and push forward: we returned to our old name, Envy Labs, but we added a long-missing taste of modernism that truly reflects us.</figcaption></figure>

We returned to our old name—one with history, recognition, and a dash of fun. Us trying to get away
from being “others-focused” (envy) only drew us right back in at the end.

Speaking to the pure design of it, our new lockup is a union of three shapes forming an abstract “e”
that represent the developers, production team, and designers that make everything happen (can you
guess which of the shapes represents the special snowflake designers?). Our typeface is a grotesque
with notable geometric properties, evoking the forms and philosophies of mid-century modernism.
We’re a modernist company, after all — we believe in the truth of forms, reduction of waste, and
simplicity of execution. And of course, having “envy” in our name mandates we use some hue of green
as a brand color; as designers we don’t waste any good metaphors that fall into our laps.

In terms of our brand it’s a mere symbol — a vehicle for a message. And that message is: **we don’t
exist without clients and their existing problems**. We don’t exist without others. As soon as the
world runs out of problems to solve, Envy Labs closes its doors (and that would be amazing!).

This might not be an _independent_ identity—it can’t exist apart from other people. But for where
Envy Labs is now, it’s perfect. And for the foreseeable future, we don’t want to imagine our purpose
divorced from real-world problems.

# Breaking out of our bubble

With this new identity, we aim to be deeply-rooted in culture. To take another page from

<div class="by sk"><div><div class="by" role="tooltip" aria-hidden="false" aria-describedby="27" aria-labelledby="27">[Grant McCracken](https://medium.com/u/8538498fa7a2?source=post_page-----e915a3d64e53--------------------------------)</div></div></div>’s
metaphorical book:

We pay dearly if we don’t respond to culture, and we pay dearly when we don’t respond to change.

A reason why we lost sight of our purpose, for a short time, was we were so enamored with ourselves.
We had a good thing going. But the world doesn’t revolve around us, and Envy Labs doesn’t exist
without real problems to solve. And we’re aiming to fix that by breaking out of our bubbles.

Along with this rebrand, we’ve also invested time inventorying what matters most to us. That’s a
separate conversation entirely, but here’s a short list of things we care about deeply right now:

- Healthcare
- Education
- Orlando
- Open source software

 and me helping a packed room of students start their careers in May 2017. We’re getting back to what matters: people.</figcaption></figure>

We’re not content to let the world—and culture—pass us by, and we’re going to be spending a lot less
time focusing on what we are / are not, and instead spend more time focusing on others, and how we
can or can not help them. We’ll help the ones we can, and do the best to refer the ones we can’t to
the right place.

Envy Labs’ brand and meaning is solving others’ problems.

So, how can we help you?
