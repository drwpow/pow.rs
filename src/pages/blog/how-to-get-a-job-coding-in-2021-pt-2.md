_2022 update: this advice still applies in 2022. I‚Äôll update anything if it gets outdated üôÇ_

Picking up from [part 1][pt-1], your starting point for coding comes from answering 2 questions:

1. backend or frontend?
2. which programming language?

Having introduced question 1 in [part 1][pt-1], let‚Äôs move on to question #2: **programming
language.** As backend or frontend use different languages, we‚Äôll address each discipline
separately.

## backend

There are far too many backend languages to list here, but I‚Äôll start with my personal
recommendations for 2021, in order (with some languages I‚Äôd recommend avoiding at first):

1. ‚úÖ **[Elixir/Phoenix][phoenix]**: I‚Äôve heard nothing but love and praise for developers of Elixir
   (programming language), and Phoenix (the web framework built on Elixir). If you want to pick
   something that‚Äôs fun to write and has a great job demand, you can‚Äôt go wrong with Elixir/Phoenix.
   It gets my pick for highest recommendation for most people.
1. ‚úÖ **[Go][go]**: Go, a.k.a. ‚ÄúGolang‚Äù (which is more searchable), is a wonderful programming
   language whose demand is on fire and only rising. Though it‚Äôs not the most popular backend
   language today, its rapid growth seems to suggest it may be soon. Droves of companies are moving
   from older systems to use Go because it‚Äôs well-designed, efficient, and has a ton of tools
   that were designed to make programming for the modern web simple and fun. But best of all, Go has
   an easy learning curve while still teaching good habits!
1. ‚úÖ **[Node.js][node]**: JavaScript for backend is called Node.js. If you are thinking about
   keeping the door to frontend open, this should probably be your choice. But if you are intent on
   purely staying backend, I think the other options are better.
1. ü§∑ **[Ruby on Rails][rails]**: Neutral recommendation: Ruby on Rails is still in use and has
   its dedicated community, but growth has stagnated and its future is unsure. Many companies are
   migrating away from Rails in favor of Elixir/Phoenix, Go, or something else (with Phoenix
   being made up of a large diaspora of former Rails devs). Soft recommendation to avoid unless you
   have your sights set on a specific job that you know 100% is Rails.
1. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **[Rust][rust]**: Rust is my favorite programming language, hands down. I love writing it, I
   think it is/will transform programming as we know it, and I am a huge believer in its future. I
   also think it‚Äôs beginner-friendly, which only adds to its appeal. But while I think Rust as a
   language is mature, in the industry at large it‚Äôs only being used today by experimental
   companies and early adopters. Job demand now and the next few years is impossible to predict.
   If you have an infinite timeline on getting into coding, Rust is definitely the long term
   investment, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to people trying to get a job today (in 2022).
1. ‚ùå **[Java][java]**: Java is essential for Android devs, but for the web I‚Äôm seeing more
   companies move away from it in favor of newer technologies. I‚Äôd recommend avoiding it unless
   you want to possibly go into Android development.
1. ‚ùå **[Python][python]**: Django was a great Python web framework that had its time, but Python
   for backend is obsolete. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîPython is a wonderful language that has a bright
   future ahead of it in data analysis and some niche areas of programming like fonts and
   generative art. But since we‚Äôre talking only about the web, please do not learn Python for this purpose.
1. ‚ùå **[PHP][php]**: avoid. Even though PHP is consistently top 5 most popular programming
   languages and will remain for a while, I strongly recommend _not_ learning it as a first
   language. It is very easy to fall into bad habits, and you‚Äôre also competing with jobs with
   millions of other PHP developers, often with lower pay than other languages. Come back to it in
   the future if you really want to (but I‚Äôve personally not met anyone that does).
1. ‚ùå **COBOL**: [no. Just, no.](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/why-cobol-is-still-used)

There are hundreds of other languages not listed here, of course. If it‚Äôs a popular language
(C, C+, etc.) and not listed above, assume it‚Äôs not used for web (unfortunately there‚Äôs not a
dual-purpose language used for both web and game development, unless Rust becomes both!).
There are also some other niche languages which _are_ used for web (Erlang, Clojure, Elm, OCaml,
etc.), but they are niche and I don‚Äôt recommend them for beginners because the path to landing
a job will be very tricky. My recommendation is limit your starting point to one of above,
and after getting some professional experience with one of those, then feel free to branch out.

### backend next steps

So, say you have picked a language to try out, and want to get started! What do you do?

1. **Attend [meetups][meetup]!** Attend any in your area you can find. With COVID, many are online,
   so you can even attend remotely.
1. Get plugged into your **local dev community.** Search for `[my city] developer Discord` and join.
   Ask questions, and meet new people in the same boat as you.
1. Find a beginner‚Äôs tutorial in your preferred language. Click on the links above to find some good
   starting tutorials.
1. Once you‚Äôve learned a bit, practice using a site like [Codewars][codewars]. Start with the
   easiest exercises (8 kyu). If you never practice programming, it‚Äôll never click!
1. Watch YouTube tutorials on your language of choice. You may find the explanations helpful!
1. When you feel that you‚Äôre starting to get a handle on your language, work on a project! For
   backend, try and build a REST API using your chosen language. Google search for
   `[language] build REST API` and see what all it entails.
1. Lastly, post code to [GitHub][github]! Landing your first job will require you having a GitHub
   profile, and code to look at. Can be big, can be small. Can be simple exercises. Just upload _as
   much as possible_ to GitHub!

## frontend

Good news and bad news: as a frontend dev, the good news is your languages are already decided for
you: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But the bad news is that for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there are a
million different ways to compose these, from [JS frameworks][js-frameworks] to HTML preprocessors
to CSS utilities. It‚Äôs a lot to learn! But as always, start with the basics.

1. [Learn HTML][html]. Simple, right?
1. [Learn CSS][css]. Now we‚Äôre cookin‚Äô!
1. Learn a framework\* such as React, Vue, or Svelte. My personal opinion is I find [Vue][vue] to be
   not only the easiest to learn after learning HTML, but it‚Äôs also powerful, widely-used, and
   teaches good habits.

_\* Note: my advice to learn a framework first is considered controversial to some, with many
recommended tackling plain, raw JavaScript instead. I advocate for JS frameworks in the beginning
for the following reasons: there are more clear ways to accomplish things, it teaches good habits,
the communities are easier to tap into, and most importantly, companies hire for frameworks so jobs
are easier to find._

### frontend next steps

So, how do you practice frontend?

1. **Attend [meetups][meetup]!** Attend any in your area you can find. With COVID, many are online,
   so you can even attend remotely.
1. Get plugged into your **local dev community.** Search for `[my city] developer Discord` and join.
   Ask questions, and meet new people in the same boat as you.
1. Create your personal site‚Äîyour blog, about you, your interests, etc.. You‚Äôll need one to apply!
   Practice building your own site, and iterate on it ([inspiration][personalsites]).
1. Push your site to [GitHub][github] so others can see (employers will look at this)!
1. [Deploy your site][netlify] online (this is the fun part!)

## backend & frontend: landing the job

It‚Äôs never too early to start searching for [backend jobs][backend] or [frontend jobs][frontend].
Even if you don‚Äôt apply, look at the requirements. Look at what‚Äôs expected. Search GlassDoor and the
internet for as much info as you can find about their interview process. And when you meet [half of
the requirements, apply anyway][job-requirements] (what‚Äôs the worst that can happen?). And above
all, don‚Äôt get discouraged; [landing that first job takes time][applying]!

I can‚Äôt say this enough: there is plenty of room for more coders, there‚Äôs never been a time to join,
and you (yes, _you_!) matter, and would make the coding community better.
