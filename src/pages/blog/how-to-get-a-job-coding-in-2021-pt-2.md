Picking up from [part 1][pt-1], your starting point for coding comes from answering 2 questions:

1. backend or frontend?
2. which programming language?

Having introduced question 1 in [part 1][pt-1], let‚Äôs move on to question #2: **programming
language.** As backend or frontend use different languages, we‚Äôll address each discipline
separately.

## backend

There are far too many backend languages to list here, but I‚Äôll start with my personal
recommendations for 2021, in order (with some languages I‚Äôd recommend avoiding at first):

1. ‚úÖ **[Go][go]**: A fantastic programming language that is rising quickly through the ranks.
   Though it‚Äôs not the most popular backend language today, its rapid growth seems to suggest it may
   be soon. Droves of companies are moving from older systems to use Go because it‚Äôs well-designed,
   efficient, and has a ton of tools. But best of all, Go has an easy learning curve while still
   teaching good habits!
1. ‚úÖ **[Elixir/Phoenix][phoenix]**: Technically Elixir is the programming language, and Phoenix is
   a framework built on Elixir. But Phoenix is so powerful and fun to use, it might make sense to
   start there! Phoenix is already in wide usage, and is growing in popularity.
1. ‚úÖ **[Node.js][node]**: JavaScript for backend is called Node.js. If you are thinking about
   keeping the door to frontend open, this should probably be your choice. But if you are intent on
   purely staying backend, I think the other options are better.
1. ü§∑ **[Ruby on Rails][rails]**: Neutral recommendation: Ruby on Rails is still in demand, but less
   today than previous years. Much of the Rails community has moved on to Elixir/Phoenix, and I
   think that‚Äôs the better investment today.
1. ‚ùå **[Java][java]**: Even though Java is in wide usage today, I‚Äôm seeing more companies move away
   from Java to newer technologies like Elixir/Phoenix or Go. Java is still widely-used in Android
   world, but for web, backend devs seem to be moving on.
1. ‚ùå **[Python][python]**: Django was a great Python web framework that had its time, but I see
   Python for backend becoming more and more obsolete. It‚Äôs a slow language that makes it hard to
   build high-performance scalable architecture. It‚Äôs great for hobby projects and data analysis.
   But for backend I think Python will fall by the wayside.
1. ‚ùå **[PHP][php]**: avoid. This is a strong opinion here. Even though PHP is extremely popular,
   and powers many websites, I recommend _not_ learning it as a first language. It is very easy to
   fall into bad habits, and there are too many PHP tutorials to separate the good from the bad.

There are hundreds of other languages not listed here that you can look more into. But other
languages may be more niche for web dev, and you‚Äôll find it harder to start there.

### backend next steps

So, say you have picked a language to try out, and want to get started! What do you do?

1. **Attend [meetups][meetup]!** Attend any in your area you can find. With COVID, many are online,
   so you can even attend remotely.
1. Get plugged into your **local dev community.** Search for `[my city] developer Discord` and join.
   Ask questions, and meet new people in the same boat as you.
1. Find a beginner‚Äôs tutorial in your preferred language. Click on the links above to find some good
   starting tutorials.
1. Once you‚Äôve learned a bit, practice using a site like [Codewars][codewars]. Start with the
   easiest exercises (8 kyu). If you never practice programming, it‚Äôll never click!
1. Watch YouTube tutorials on your language of choice. You may find the explanations helpful!
1. When you feel that you‚Äôre starting to get a handle on your language, work on a project! For
   backend, try and build a REST API using your chosen language. Google search for
   `[language] build REST API` and see what all it entails.
1. Lastly, post code to [GitHub][github]! Landing your first job will require you having a GitHub
   profile, and code to look at. Can be big, can be small. Can be simple exercises. Just upload _as
   much as possible_ to GitHub!

## frontend

Good news and bad news: as a frontend dev, the good news is your languages are already decided for
you: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But the bad news is that for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there are a
million different ways to compose these, from [JS frameworks][js-frameworks] to HTML preprocessors
to CSS utilities. It‚Äôs a lot to learn! But as always, start with the basics.

1. [Learn HTML][html]. Simple, right?
1. [Learn CSS][css]. Now we‚Äôre cookin‚Äô!
1. Learn a framework\* such as React, Vue, or Svelte. My personal opinion is I find [Vue][vue] to be
   not only the easiest to learn after learning HTML, but it‚Äôs also powerful, widely-used, and
   teaches good habits.

_\* Note: my advice to learn a framework first is considered controversial to some, with many
recommended tackling plain, raw JavaScript instead. I advocate for JS frameworks in the beginning
for the following reasons: there are more clear ways to accomplish things, it teaches good habits,
the communities are easier to tap into, and most importantly, companies hire for frameworks so jobs
are easier to find._

### frontend next steps

So, how do you practice frontend?

1. **Attend [meetups][meetup]!** Attend any in your area you can find. With COVID, many are online,
   so you can even attend remotely.
1. Get plugged into your **local dev community.** Search for `[my city] developer Discord` and join.
   Ask questions, and meet new people in the same boat as you.
1. Create your personal site‚Äîyour blog, about you, your interests, etc.. You‚Äôll need one to apply!
   Practice building your own site, and iterate on it ([inspiration][personalsites]).
1. Push your site to [GitHub][github] so others can see (employers will look at this)!
1. [Deploy your site][netlify] online (this is the fun part!)

## backend & frontend: landing the job

It‚Äôs never too early to start searching for [backend jobs][backend] or [frontend jobs][frontend].
Even if you don‚Äôt apply, look at the requirements. Look at what‚Äôs expected. Search GlassDoor and the
internet for as much info as you can find about their interview process. And when you meet [half of
the requirements, apply anyway][job-requirements] (what‚Äôs the worst that can happen?). And above
all, don‚Äôt get discouraged; [landing that first job takes time][applying]!

I can‚Äôt say this enough: there is plenty of room for more coders, there‚Äôs never been a time to join,
and you (yes, _you_!) matter, and would make the coding community better.
