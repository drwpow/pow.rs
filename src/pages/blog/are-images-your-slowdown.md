This article covers the image export half of optimization. For the server half, read Nathaniel
Bibler’s
[DevOps article on the same subject](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/tuning-slow-images-with-devops-6ea874718ab)

This year, the HTTPArchive chugged through over **44.3 trillion** kB of images on websites. That’s
enough to go to the moon and back _35 times!_

_Wait — that doesn’t make sense._

Er, let me start again. We’ve (_we_–the internet, not _we_–Envy) recently tipped the scales at
**1.9MB** for the [average page weight](http://httparchive.org/trends.php), **63% of which is due to
images alone**. There’s little doubt that our corpulent friend, the image, needs a little help
trimming down.

Can your site load in 2 seconds like
[your users expect it to](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/)? No? Then images are probably
your slow-down.

At Envy, our image optimization process is 3-fold:

1. Picking the right format
1. Picking the right size
1. Optimizing via [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) and [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)

### 1: The Formats

_Update: ImageOptim is really good at optimizing PNGs, especially if you enable lossy minification.
PNG24 will more than likely be sufficient for most cases._

These are merely rule-of-thumbs, and any format will surprise you. Be aware of compression
tendencies, but always experiment.

The most essential part of image optimization is understanding the basics of each file format.
Ideally, your image weight should be split between:

- **SVG** for low-color images (and everything you possibly can)
- **JPG** for photos, paintings, or any other high-color imagery (including screenshots containing
  these)
- **PNG** for any images needing
  [true transparency](http://www.sitepoint.com/gif-jpg-png-whats-difference/) (or when PNG-8 is
  being stupid)

Just about any graphics software these days can export / change file type. Whatever you use, **make
sure you convert to sRGB color space**. That’s important to make sure your colors show up the same
on everybody else’s monitors.

#### What about GIF?

You know when you need GIF: _animation_. If possible, try to use MP4 (H.264) instead.

### 2: Image Resolution

_Note: the word_ Retina™ _is used to mean all “high-pixel-density” screens, regardless of
manufacturer. I also use Kleenexes® and Band-aids®._

We save out retina (2×) and normal image assets for all of our non-vector assets. The actual size
depends on the content; if we have full-bleed (edge-to-edge) images we’ll typically save 2 versions:

- `752w` for mobile devices (if it saves bandwidth over `1280w`)
- `1280w` for desktop
- `2560w` for retina tablets and large displays

If you use [webpack](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/getting-started-with-webpack-2-ed2b86c68783), you
can easily resize on-the-fly thanks to loaders like
[srcset-loader](https://github.com/timse/srcset-loader).

We’ll also make adjustments to resolution from there based on importance. Primary photos, since
they’re main content, will have to be crisp and vivid, so we may make those higher-resolution than
normal. But for background textures where pixelation is less noticeable, we can afford to crunch
those images a little more.

In both instances, pixel density media queries such as

```css
@media only screen and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx) {
  /* retina styles here */
}
```

work wonders for keeping your code performant across platforms without sacrificing your vibrant,
high-resolution imagery. In our Sass-fueled environment at Envy, we’ll use functions such as:

```css
=retina($width) @media only screen and (min-width: #{$width}) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)
  @content // Example
    .container
      background-image: url('bg.jpg') // 960w image +retina(960px)
      background-image: url('bg@2x.jpg') // 1920w image
```

to only load high-resolution images when the screen is a) a minimum width, and b) capable of even
showing retina imagery. If you didn’t have `min-width` as part of the query, for example, you’d be
bogging down all your iPhone 6/7/8/X visitors (a 750px display) with 1920px-wide imagery—a complete
waste of bandwidth and memory.

All-in-all, the main idea for effective image resolution is asking: _Where am I wasting resolution
and bandwidth on images that don’t need it?_

#### JPG tip: resolution &gt; quality

A neat trick, since we live in the era of browser scaling, is to actually save out JPGs at 2×
resolution and at low quality. You can then use CSS to down-scale the images, and the final result
is not only a fraction of its original size, but is now retina-enabled as well.

_Note: you can reduce quality through ImageOptim in the next step, after you’ve adjusted the
resolution._

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bEP7MkNYzQvEbcGD.png"></figure>

Experiment with different quality settings and resolutions on an image-by-image basis to find what
works best for filesize vs image clarity. But the basic concept is **resolution &gt;
quality** — bigger resolution, low quality always wins over low resolution, high quality.

JPGs gonna JPG (translation: you’re dealing with a lossy format regardless; use it to your advantage
rather than try to fight it).

_Caveat: this trick doesn’t work as well for pages with heavy animations, or pages with large
numbers of images — it can get very resource-intensive pretty quickly. Also be sure to test
performance in all mobile browsers you’re targeting._

### 3: ImageOptim & SVGO

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*miXGQ690IcMGv9Asd73Akw.png"><figcaption>ImageOptim: lossy compression is bae</figcaption></figure>

[ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/) contains a small army of image optimization tools — PNGOUT,
Zopfli, Pngcrush, AdvPNG, extended OptiPNG, JpegOptim, jpegrescan, jpegtran, and Gifsicle — while
[SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) does one thing and one thing only: SVG-smashing. Both tools are
absolutely indispensable in shaving cruft off of images with no time taken and at no quality
reduction to you.

ImageOptim is cake: principally pop a portfolio of pictures into its porthole to perceive its
profound prestidigitations (drag-and-drop a folder into the ImageOptim window — that’s it!).

You can either conservatively crunch your images with **lossless compression** (default), or you can
enable **lossy compression** in the settings (what I recommend) for the absolute smallest images
sizes you can handle. Further, ImageOptim is also fully-usable
[via command-line](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI) as well. For Windows users,
sorry — you can’t get the nice little bundle, but you can get access to
[similar libraries](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI#windows-and-linux) that do
essentially the same thing.

Note that if you use lossy compression, you **do not** have to export images at a lower quality from
Photoshop, etc. Typically, I’ll save images out at 100% and let ImageOptim do the quality downsizing
(make sure to make a copy first if you’re testing out quality without ruining your image).

SVGO (command-line only) does the same but for SVGs
[GUI version here](https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui)). You may encounter some difficulties if your
vector artwork is unusually complicated, but for the vast majority of artwork, SVGO is pure magic.

### The Future

Google’s new WebP format has not only broken records in file savings and image quality but might
possibly be the first web format in history to have
[a mainstream media source actually care](http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/21/technology/innovationnation/google-webp/).
It boasts
[26% savings over PNG and 25–34% savings over JPG](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/). The
catch? None! It’s going to be great. But currently, Google is the only one using Google’s image
format (Safari, Firefox, and IE are quiet about supporting it anytime soon). The numbers don’t lie,
and we may very well be heralding a new image king in the future.

_Author note: Opera does, in fact, support WebP. But wasn’t mentioned due to the sad fact that
although Opera supports many forward-thinking web standards, the internet as a whole doesn’t exactly
support Opera._

#### Picture & srcset

The [picture element](http://caniuse.com/#search=picture) and
[srcset](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset) responsive helpers — not _formats_, per se — are close but
not ready for prime-time just yet. Ideally, these will modify how you use the `<img>` tag on sites,
but we’re still currently waiting for implementation in
[Safari and IE](http://responsiveimages.org/#implementation). In the meantime, keep your eye on
browser adoption and we will, too.

_P.S.: for those cheeky individuals who checked the page weight of this exact blog post and found a
1MB image_

Firstly: good on you! Let me be the first to congratulate you in bringing the prometheal light of
fast, performant internet to mortals.

But to quote Ricky Ricardo, lemme splain myself: I had to include a nearly-1MB PNG-24 in order to
show every pixel of JPG compression accurately. If I used JPG instead, I would have JPG-compressed
my JPG compression. _Yo Dawg!_ (yes, JPG is lossy even at 100% quality).

_Making heavy-weighted pages to talk about image page weight. How… meta._ Have to crack a few eggs
to make an omelette, I suppose.
