## Building the Factory

Custom development boils down to one word: **automation.** It is simply the automation of a product
or service, carried out by servers.

Custom development is much like an assembly line in a factory: work goes into designing and building
this complicated mega-machine that assembles a product as rapidly as possible. It starts with a
product that there is a demand for. Then, to meet that demand, the product is broken down into its
elemental pieces. In the example of a car, each piece — engine, frame, wheels, transmission, etc. —
is assembled individually and then pieced together into a finished product. When this concept of the
assembly line first came out in the early 1900s (for those keeping score, it was not Henry Ford; it
was Ransom Olds that patented the assembly line in 1901 for Oldsmobile), it reduced Henry Ford’s
Model T production time from 12 hours to **93 minutes.**

It’s efficient, to say the least.

But let’s put the product aside for a second and focus for now on the _factory_: in order to _make_
a car engine, for example, imagine the machines necessary to cast the metal, drill the holes, and
everything else involved from turning raw metal into a finished, machined part. Even if you don’t
know anything about car engines, you can still acknowledge that the machines within a Ford _Mustang_
factory have to be different from the machines within a Land Rover _Range Rover_ factory simply
because those are different automobiles with different sizes and different parts. To make different
products, either the same machines must behave differently, or there must be different machines
altogether. In other words, **a factory — made of machines working together — is built and
customized around a unique product, not the other way around.**

For our last imaginary exercise, we’re going to imagine how much effort it would take to convert a
Honda car factory into a gummy bear factory. _Those things are nothing alike_, you say. All
factories use similar machines if we’re referring to the basic principles of mechanics, but instead
of casting iron you’re now casting gelatin and high fructose corn syrup. Instead of drilling engine
parts, you’re punching that little hole to slide the hanging plastic bag onto the hanger. And we’re
not even mentioning food safety standards, at which your ex-car-now-food factory will spectacularly
fail. In another instance, converting one type of car factory into a different car brand would take
considerably less effort. But regardless, if the product changes, the machinery changes as well, to
varying degrees based on the required change.

A web app is the factory; the product it produces is _your_ product. Web apps are
amazingly-efficient, custom machines built around delivering your product as rapidly as possible
(milliseconds, to be exact). But unlike factories, web apps have the potential to be even more
diverse and complicated from one web app to another. Web apps can do everything from
[scheduling a flower delivery](https://postmates.com/) (when is your mom’s birthday again?), to
[exploring the surface of Mars](https://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/), to
[controlling robots remotely](https://www.particle.io/). But I don’t have to tell you all that the
internet can do — after all, you’re using the internet right now (whoa!). Though it’s overwhelming
to ponder all the paths down which custom development road can lead, it always starts at the same
point: **you’re building a web app around one — and only one — product.**

## What’s the product?

A unique scaffolding will be built around your product, and as the product changes and grows,
sometimes a machine or two will need adjustment.

If your understanding of your own product is cloudy, how do you expect an application to automate
it? Imagine you are trying to mass produce your own car line, but you haven’t decided on a
transmission type. Halfway through construction of a factory engineered to produce 5-speed cars, you
change it to 6-speed, then wonder in dismay as the project suddenly skyrockets over-budget and past
deadline. _I only changed one thing,_ you say, without realizing that one decision affected the
driveshaft, gearbox, dashboard interior, onboard computer, and a plethora of other things this
particular article writer doesn’t fully understand about cars.

Continuing the discussion from
[Part One](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/the-distributed-web-part-1-you-dont-need-a-website-7d3b69243a5d),
remember that you’re at the point of custom development because there’s absolutely no other service
in existence that can deliver your unique product. There’s no factory that can assemble your wares.
So you’re building your own, which means **a very large, complicated thing now depends on the
tiniest details of your product.**

To be clear: you don’t have to know the first thing about web development. That’s our job (and we’re
open about our
[discovery process](http://madewithenvy.com/ecosystem/articles/2015/discovery-meetings/) and
[how we start projects](http://madewithenvy.com/process)). But you, as a client, are responsible for
two things:

1. Knowing your product intimately
1. Understanding that what we build is customized to your unique product

Just because code isn’t physical — like a building — doesn’t mean it’s any easier to change its
structure. Much like the thousands of girders of a building are meant to support its unique
structure, or like the thousands of moving parts in a factory are designed to yield only one
product, the thousands upon thousands of lines of code in an application are similarly designed to
yield one specific product.

I should mention: to those that know the craft, there _are_ some changes the structure affords with
little difficulty. There are some changes a product may undergo as it evolves and grows, and, yes,
sometimes a machine or two will need adjustment that impacts scope for the sake of product
improvement. This is one of the reasons we at Envy bill [hourly](http://madewithenvy.com/process)
and don’t engage in fixed-bid projects. But the more strategic and focused your changes are, the
more you’ll lessen the negative impact of change, and the more time and money you’ll save in the
development process. If, in the transmission example above, the request was motivated by a desire
for fuel efficiency, we’d suggest instead a more optimal wheel diameter that is similarly effective
in gas mileage savings
([source](http://www.tuneruniversity.com/blog/2011/04/wheel-tech-part-iii-wheel-diameters-effect-on-performance/)).
But our solution, by comparison, caused virtually no setback because cars are designed to accept a
range of wheel diameters.

It’s as much your job to know your product as it is our job to guide you through improvements as
efficiently as possible that _support_ and _enhance_ your product rather than cause constant
upheaval.

## Where should we build?

Your next question is undoubtedly _how much does custom development cost? \_You probably also knew
this was coming: \_it depends._

As much as I’d like to break down a formula for development, it really does depend on your
strategies as a business, much like it matters whether you’re opening a gummy bear factory or a
motorized prosthetic hand factory. Determining cost depends on what _type_ of development you
pursue, of which there are 3 major types:

1. Web Apps (dot-com-based)
1. Native Device Apps (iOS, Android)
1. Native Desktop Apps (Mac, Windows)

The next question to answer is **where / how do your users need to access your product?**

The best bang for your buck is web apps, because those are accessible on any device: mobile, tablet,
laptop, and desktop. But web apps aren’t a silver bullet for everything as they require an always-on
internet connection that native applications don’t. As a designer, I couldn’t imagine needing
internet to run Illustrator from my laptop as I kill time in the passenger seat of a car. If I am
looking up a rock climbing guide for a particular area, I don’t want to bring my laptop if my phone
will do, and I probably won’t have an internet/cell phone connection when I need the guide most,
either.

_So is native development the way to go?_ Not always; native development requires a large investment
for you to silo your product into one specific type of device such as iPhone or Windows PC, and if
that device receives a major update or just
[dies completely](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9292695/amazon-fire-phone-sales-end), you have to
re-invest all over again. If, for example, you developed an online shopping experience only on
Android, you may find your customer base severely limited. Alternately, if you developed a
learn-to-code website such as [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), it’s safe to assume users
have a steady internet connection and would want a full keyboard anyway — web app is the way to go
here. Understanding on which devices your users need your product, and the times / conditions during
which most people use your product makes the decision clearer. There’s not a universally correct
answer; **the end result is always as unique as your product.**

We’ll go into each of the three development types in greater detail in future blog installments —
there’s a lot to talk about for each of those three, and we haven’t even scratched the surface.

## Recap

The end result is always as unique as your product.

Maybe this blog post didn’t give you the clearest picture about the finer details of custom
development, but remember: it’s always about _your unique product_, and no one else’s. The next step
is to find a development agency to build your product, but before you get there, these are the most
important questions to answer as the foundation for custom development:

1. What is my product?
1. How does my product absolutely require an online component?
1. Do I know my product well enough that it won’t change as I’m paying for development of a web app
   / native app?
1. How will users need to use my product — desktop? Mobile phone on the go?
1. Am I willing to pay for development for native development for multiple devices?

If Henry Ford could increase his product output by 800% with automation in 1913, just imagine what
custom development could do for your product in 2016.

You bring the product; we’ll handle the factory.
