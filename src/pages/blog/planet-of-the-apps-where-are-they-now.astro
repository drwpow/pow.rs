<PostLayout content={frontmatter}>
  <p>Over the holiday break I remembered <i>Planet of the Apps</i> was an actual show and not a fever dream I had. In case you missed it, it was the first TV show produced by Apple, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/planet-of-the-apps/umc.cmc.5itv0kq48rjp52jzau2nmmf4q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released on Apple Music</a> in 2017 (2 years before Apple TV+, mind you, where else could they have released it?). It only ran for one season (10 episodes) and copied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shark Tank</a> formula of having a panel of 4 entrepreneurs/advisors judge an elevator pitch. All the business ideas involved apps in the Apple App store, hence the whole <em>Apple</em> branding.</p>
  <p>On paper it had all the ingredients of what could have been a good TV show and perfect marketing for Apple: the “land of opportunity” sparkle in every contestant’s eyes, a (mostly) star-studded ensemble cast, decent production value, and it was made during the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/apple-is-the-first-1-trillion-company-in-history/2018/08/02/ea3e7a02-9599-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second dot com boom</a> where the general public was more enraptured by big tech than skeptical. I also like that they take it one step further than Shark Tank, and also show real VCs bidding on the pitch.</p>
  <p>But the <em>specific</em> celebrities they chose for the panel of judges are what makes this show so cringingly-excruciating to watch. You have Gary Vaynerchuk, a.k.a. <q>Gary Vee</q>, the poster <strike>child</strike> alpha male of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgJLomt4MhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hustle culture</a></em>. will.i.am, musician-turned-<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/5/7162861/will-i-am-puls-smartwatch-is-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed tech entrepreneur</a> (but I suppose in hindsight having <i>apple.de.app</i> instead would have been too confusing). And the queen of <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/gwyneth-paltrow-and-goop-another-triumph-of-celebrity-pseudoscience-and-quackery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">snake oil and quackery</a> herself, Gwenyth Paltrow. The fourth investor, Jessica Alba (actress-turned-founder of Honest Co), I have nothing bad to say about. But neither she nor her showmates has a clue about starting and running a tech business, and every time they open their mouth, pure comedy ensues.</p>
  <p>And that is why I love watching this show.</p>
  <p>It felt as if Apple really wanted to make the show about the Lightspeed VC partners but couldn’t afford them, so they filmed all the VC pitches together in a matter of hours and shoved whatever celebrities they could find in their stupid set they built (complete with a real escalator you had to ride on to give your elevator pitch<em>—IT WASN’T EVEN AN ACTUAL ELEVATOR</em>). Gary’s eyes glaze over as the big words pour out. will.i.am always looks stoned out of his mind. Zane Lowe is just happy to be included. It’s wonderful.</p>

  <p>While rewatching this (out-of-touch-with-) reality show, I began to wonder what happened to the founders and businesses that got their 15 minutes of fame, but couldn’t find anyone talking about this show after it happened (apparently I am all this show’s fanbase has left). Still curious, and realizing I’d have to do some digging anyway, I figured I might as well write it down in a blog post. So without further ado, in order of appearance:</p>

  <p>Jessica, bless her heart, did everything within her power to educate Andrew, help his business model, and get him connected to as many people as she could. And Andrew is likeable enough to make for great TV listening to his entrepreneurial-everyman struggles of feeding his family beans & rice on months when there’s no salary to pull. Though Andrew knocked the demo out of the park—both the initial pitch and VC pitch—he failed to secure funding because there didn’t seem to be any depth to the business model. But fortunately the tech was impressive enough for <a href="https://mandasoft.com/acquisition/?viewmodes=1&acquisitionID=69205&title=Manor_Financial_Inc__acquired_Pair_Inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an acquisition in 2019</a>.

  <p>Gary spent the entire show telling Lexie and Jake how great and smart he is while spouting intro-to-business level advice they had already done years ago. The duo did score $1m investment from Lightspeed, but the app mysteriously vanished into thin air right after the episode aired. Almost as if both founders mutually agreed to kill the company to avoid ever having to listen to Gary’s voice again. After the show, Jake suddently became an investor (possibly with $1m in pocket?), while Lexie went on to just work at other companies (she’s currently a Product Manager at Warner Bros.).</p>

  <p>This is peak will.i.am and the reason I watch the show: convincing a poor young developer to turn his beloved fitness app into a Pokémon-inspired battle game. This is another happy ending, because though the app failed to raise a user base and ultimately ran out of money, the founder went on to be an iOS developer for Apple. And gets to text will.i.am from time-to-time (which, being honest, is the greatest reward of all).</p>

  <p>In what is probably the most realistic depiction of Silicon Valley VC funding, a charismatic founder convinces Lightspeed to throw gobs of money at hopping on a bandwagon they don’t want to miss. And in an even-more realistic depiction of Silicon Valley, Dote would go on to become an influencer mega-brand that would raise $23m in funding and be at the center of viral Instagram Fiji shopping trips until it would die <a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/from-multimillion-dollar-company-to-ghost-the-rise-and-fall-of-dote-8724482c0d15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from scandals that women of color at the company were treated differently than white women</a>.

Gwenyth spends the rest of the episode trying to say <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> as naturally as possible, likely because those are the only clips of her not hocking her essential oils and healing crystals to this poor girl. Though Lightspeed does not invest, the startup continued to operate for years successfully, leading up to <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazils-nubank-acquires-olivia-a-financial-assistant-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an acquisition in 2021</a> (one of the longer runs of apps on the show). The developer that pitched would move on to successful roles at various companies, including CEO of one and Chief of Staff of another.</p>

  <p>Kemar is a multi-talented ex-Google, ex-Apple developer-turned-founder/CEO who’s just living his best life as a sneakerhead. He picked Jessica as his mentor, probably because she’s the only person that has ever shipped real products. But most of his journey was showing the dope party in LA he threw. He won $300k from Lightspeed, and would go on to operate for a couple years with unknown resources and to unknown success (but certainly not much). I couldn’t find what Kemar’s been up to as his current title on LinkedIn is still <i>CEO of Flip</i> though the app has been inactive for years. Hopefully he made enough to just throw the parties he wanted to and is currently chilling.</p>

  <p>The founder, with no app and no skills, rejects will.i.am’s desparate pleas to accept Damon Wayans Jr.’s offer of a buyout and goes double-or-nothing in his VC pitch and loses. will.i.am sheepishly stands in the corner the whole pitch (looking fly as hell though), waiting for it to bomb, and hoping this wouldn’t be remembered (sorry, will—I remember it, and all the episodes are still free to watch on Apple Music). I couldn’t find any trace of this app ever existing outside the show other than a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/subwaytalent-an-app-for-booking-musicians" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed IndieGoGo</a>.</p>

  <p>I’m baffled why the founders chose Gary as their mentor for an education app, as once again he doesn’t seem to provide any real value other than hype crew during the VC pitch meeting. But despite the Veester’s stink on it, the company was able to grow and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/tutoring-business-in-a-box-service-clark-has-been-acquired-by-edtech-startup-noodle/">get acquired in 2019</a>.

  <p>Listening to the pitch of trying to necromance cable TV’s rotting corpse in the streaming era reminded me of the self-deprecating joke tagline to John Oliver’s podcast <i>The Bugle</i>: <q>audio newspaper for a visual world.</q> Lightspeed was already an investor, which made for horrible television as the founder and panel just had a normal low-stakes board meeting. Even will.i.am nervously wiped his sweaty brow the entire time, wondering why he was even there.

  <p>One of the more well-known apps to appear on the show, Poncho was already backed by Betaworks, parent company of other meme-y startups Digg and Giphy. At this point I don’t know why Gwenyth is picked anymore, but I really loved hearing her give them startup advice only for the founder/CEO of Giphy in the next scene to go “lol no that’s the dumbest idea ever, and the opposite of what you should do” (who, by the way, was already in their network and had no connection to Gwenyth). Following that good advice, they won the pitch, and Lightspeed accelerated Poncho to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17404650/poncho-weather-shutting-down-betaworks-dirty-lemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquihired the following year</a> to a… <em>checks notes</em>… bougie detox drink company for its developers and messaging infra.

Gary did set her up with lunch with the founder/CEO of Tinder, who told her in a classy way her idea sucks. She then proceeded to pitch her idea to a SF VC with no app and a shitty, student-quality pitchdeck, resulting in neither funding from Lightspeed nor <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/friendish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieGoGo</a>.

  <p>Jessica helps Ellen spend 6 weeks changing her brand colors. Whether it was the new shade of blue or the founder’s compelling data that sold Lightspeed to invest is hard to say. The app would go on to win the “Best of App Store 2018” award (which is not easy to get, and had nothing to do with this show). The company is still running today under a new CEO while the founder sits on the board.</p>

  <p>Gwenyth goes full Goop™ in this episode, inviting her quack spiritual healer friend to cleanse this app’s auras and remove its “againstness,” whatever that means. Michael’s eyes glaze over as it sinks in this is what selling your soul to the Devil looks like (or it could have been too many vagina candles lit). Lightspeed wasn’t too jazzed about making money off divorcees so they didn’t invest. But the product (which already had active users) is still active and alive to this day, with Michael still the full-time CEO of the company.</p>

  <p>As their perfect target demo, Gary was practically foaming at the mouth to jump on an app to grow influencers’ audiences. But I’m not sure what he did for them, as the only short clip of his mentorship consisted of pulling random people into his office to say the app looked neat. Due to an impressive demo, however, they raised some investment money from Lightspeed. But only enough to validate the idea, which seemed to not have gone anywhere. Since then, Ruben is continues to be a talented developer and entrepreneur involved in the AI and robotics space.

  <p>Jessica does what she does best and wastes 6 weeks changing colors and making inconsequential branding tweaks. The two (founder/CEO, and some influencer guy) failed their pitch as another neat tech demo with no clear business model. They were able to raise money from other sources, but I couldn’t find evidence of a downloadable app ever being released (or if they did launch, it wasn’t out for long before they pulled the plug). I couldn’t find what the CEO has been up to since the show aired. The weird influencer he brought along with him to pitch has been making Fortnight content and <a href="http://davidlehre.com/wp/portfolio/tydus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music videos with Jake Paul and a 6-year-old</a>.</p>

  <p>Thomas Suarez was somewhat of a wunderkind, known as the famous <em><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_suarez_a_12_year_old_app_developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12-year-old app developer.</a></em> Now a 17-year-old developer, he tries his hand at dabbling in entrepreneurship only to be thrust onto will.i.am to answer hard questions like what he’s doing to “clean the bugs” (will.i.am is a master chameleon, able to blend in anywhere and even speak like a seasoned developer that cleans bugs). Though his app feels like a hackathon project, Lightspeed still gives a couple months of runway to Thomas to validate his idea, even if for no other reason than maintain a connection to an ambitious kid that’s good at attracting press and clearly going places. And in a heartwarming ending, WiTag is still around, still run by Thomas, and is the legal business name of <a href="https://teleportal.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teleportal</a>.</p>

  <p>Solving the hard problem of drunk people leaving their credit cards in bars by requiring drunk people to use a shitty app instead (while charging businesses sky-high transaction fees to use said shitty app) is one business idea you could have. But it is not a business idea that can make money. The founders failed to catch any crumbs falling off Lightspeed’s table, but still tried to grow the business organically for about a year before giving up. Kyra went on to become a NYC investor while Anthony took up 3D modeling and became an animator at Pixar, which sounds like a blessing in disguise this didn’t take off.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what Bill Barhydt, a former analyst for Goldman Sachs and former director of Netscape, is doing on this show. I also don’t know why Gwenyth called one of Airbnb’s founders just so he could explain how Airbnb works like Bill is five years old (Bill is not only significantly older; you can watch him age rapidly during the call). But I do know one thing: Bill is here to peddle his crypto shit, and Lightspeed isn’t having it. Bill is still peddling his crypto shit to this day, though with it being crypto there’s no telling how successful (or not) it’s been.</p>

  <p>Finally, a music app. Time for will.i.am to shine. DJ Blackout is still doing DJ Blackout stuff.

His LinkedIn bio currently reads “#1 Cryptocurrency Real Estate Agent.”</p>
