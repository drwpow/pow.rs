This year, a major focus for me has been to grow as a designer, and I’m writing this to myself as
much as to other designers I’ve interacted with and mentored.

Many of us within the design community (especially younger designers) have fooled ourselves into
thinking we’re growing when we’re not. Though this behavior manifests itself in myriad ways, it’s
most clearly manifested itself on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), the popular designer showcase.
And to be clear, it’s not Dribbble the platform that’s the problem, nor do I think its founders
intended this. I love Dribbble, and think it’s a net gain for the design community at large. But for
all of us it’s easy to get sucked into that false measure of quantitative growth Dribbble provides
with likes and comments. We’ll this bad pattern of thinking “painkiller thinking.”

# On Painkillers

The painkiller–vitamin metaphor has made the rounds in business circles, but I heard it the first
time watching an episode of Apple’s app-themed game show _Planet of the Apps_ (I know, I know—the
show is super cheesy, but it has its moments). On one episode, one of the VC investors had the
following to say about a product he was skeptical of:

> A vitamin is something you should be doing every day, and it has a diffused benefit over time. In
> our experience as Venture Capitalists, we’ve found it’s much, much harder for products that feel
> like vitamins to reach scale and be successful than products which are more like painkillers:
> where the user is grasping for any solution, right away, because they have a burning, pressing
> headache of some sort.

Someone pitched a “vitamin” idea when he was gunning for a “painkiller” idea. Painkillers sell.
Quick, effortless results sell. **People want their problem solved instantly,** and money follows
desires.

Dribbble, for most people, is a five-minute experience. Pop it open, like some shots, close it.
Maybe if you’re doing research, you’ll even spend _fifteen_ minutes collecting shots into a bucket.
But you can only use Dribbble for reference when you’re creating visuals solely for 30-and-unders
that pull from popular design styles of the last few years. Oh, and make sure you steer clear of all
the
[useless designs that can exist nowhere else other than Dribbble itself](https://uxdesign.cc/dribbble-and-the-creation-of-the-useless-designer-3caf85805fa).

Essentially, relying on Dribbble is the same as eating Cheetos™ instead of veggies. Great as a
snack; horrible for three meals a day. It makes the bad hungry feel go away, but doesn’t leave you
with many nutrients.

Dribbble is designed to give you that instant relief: it tricks you into thinking you’re growing and
becoming a better designer in five minutes. But really all it did was stave your appetite for
growth.

If you’re carefully monitoring your own thoughts at this point, you’re probably thinking “Yeah,
yeah, OK. I get it. Dribbble is bad. What’s ‘good’ so I can agree or disagree with you and move on?”

If you’re thinking this way, _you’re still looking for that painkiller—\_that easy, quick solution.
Stop seeking out painkillers, switch to everyday vitamins, and you’ll see great results \_in
six-to-twelve months_.

# On Vitamins

So what does this “everyday” behavior look like? One example that came to my mind is Tobias
Frere-Jones, designer of the _Gotham \_typeface as well as many others you’ve probably used before
(\_Whitney_, _Archer_, _Interstate…_).

In 2015, Tobias gave a talk on bank note design. More specifically, the hundreds of minute security
details printers hid in their banknotes to detect counterfeits (it goes way deeper than the “hold up
to the light” trick):

Behind that talk was years and years of research, and along the way, Tobias collected sample after
sample after sample, initially to scratch a personal itch. His collection isn’t available online
other than the [samples he’s scanned for his blog](https://frerejones.com/blog?tag=Collections), and
I’m not sure just how large it is, but judging from him describing himself as a
“[pack rat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGVamkuQXl4),” and the obscene amount of niche
references he drops on a regular basis, I’m going to guess _a lot_.

I want you to imagine the work it takes to build your own personal archive of design samples that
have never been scanned and put online. Imagine traveling around the country to build your
collection. Imagine the hours of digging through libraries’ flat files. Calling up historians on the
phone. Calling someone _after_ calling someone. Would you still do it if you got no immediate
feedback? What if you couldn’t make a Dribbble shot, or viral tweet after every sample you found?

For Tobias, at least, the possibility of _not_ hoarding all this ephemera wouldn’t even cross his
mind. Because he’s not motivated by what will yield instant gratification, he’s seeking after what
will yield slow, long-term growth. And he isn’t the only one building his own collection—this is a
shared secret among many great designers, from [Herb Lubalin](http://lubalincenter.cooper.edu/) and
Paula Scher, to [Tad Carpenter](https://www.pinterest.com/TadCarpenter/retro-pop/),
[Allan Peters](http://allanpeters.com/category/badge-hunting/), and Aaron Draplin—all have their own
personal collections they’ve amassed, in secret, to no other end than their personal growth.

For all these designers, they know the true value in digging deep for obscure references yields the
strongest, most informed work they can possibly produce. They don’t limit themselves to simply
rehashing other designers and what’s popular; they pull from anything they can get their hands on.
There’s a chasm of difference between the two.

That daily investment for long-term growth doesn’t always have to take the form of amassing a
personal collection (though that never hurts)! Reading, studying, going to conferences, and finding
a mentor yield the same effect so long as you are investing
[quality time](http://www.businessinsider.com/new-study-destroys-malcolm-gladwells-10000-rule-2014-7)
into something, daily.

# Next Steps: Experiment, fail. Repeat.

If you’re already doing most of these things, then this article wasn’t written for you. But if
you’re lured by the temptation of measuring your growth with likes, you’re looking for painkillers
to ease the pain of growth. Dribbble is like a cookie: a wonderful snack but awful as your only
sustenance. Imagine this is your design mom talking: _eat some veggies for once, and quit eating
those pink heart cookies three meals a day_.

So what does that look like? Here are some starting suggestions:

- Reading
  [_Meggs’ History of Graphic Design_](https://www.amazon.com/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/1118772059/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501169587&sr=8-1&keywords=meggs+history+of+graphic+design).
  Yes it’s $60, and yes, it’ll be the best $60 you ever spent. How can you justify what you’re doing
  in 20XX if you have no clue what led up until now?
- Reading books from your design heroes.
  [_Thoughts on Design_](https://www.amazon.com/Thoughts-Design-Paul-Rand/dp/081187544X/) by Paul
  Rand. [_Make it Bigger_](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Bigger-Paula-Scher/dp/1568985487/) by Paula
  Scher.
  [_Things I Have Learned in My Life So Far_](https://www.amazon.com/Things-have-learned-life-Updated/dp/141970964X/)
  by Stefan Sagmeister.
- [**Learning. To. Draw.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7l0mIlzx_I)
- Making a spreadsheet of _every typeface from independent foundries_ (I believe what you heard was
  “a lot of typefaces.” I said “every typeface from independent foundries”), like
  [Indra Kupferschmidt](https://twitter.com/kupfers/status/170652173435285504), a professional
  typographer, does. Pull from [Typographica](http://typographica.org/category/typeface-reviews/),
  [Fonts In Use](https://fontsinuse.com/), and
  [my personal foundry shortlist](https://blog.madewithenvy.com/check-out-these-foundries-for-new-fonts-75c0b9c07945),
  if you don’t know where to start.
- Collecting items from archive sites like [Archive.org](http://archive.org/) and
  [Fonts In Use](https://fontsinuse.com/). Both are ephemera goldmines from everything from
  [’80s imagery](https://fontsinuse.com/tags/401/1980s) to
  [mid-century car manuals](https://archive.org/details/studebaker_owners_manual_1956) (hint: you
  can use Archive.org’s [advanced search](https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php) to narrow by date,
  and on Fonts In Use you can search for “1980s,” etc.).
- Study [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGc-K7giqKM),
  [game](https://ridwankhan.com/the-ui-and-ux-of-persona-5-183180eb7cce)
  [design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM), or
  [data visualization](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Information-Graphics/dp/0393347281).

This should open the pathway to something like Tobias Frere-Jones’ bank notes collecting habit
mentioned earlier. Start your own habit! The very thing you might need most for your personal growth
looking is probably lurking in some place nobody could have ever pointed you to (not even a Medium
article)—**some place deep, and dark, and remote; a place only aimless wandering could have
reached**. Somewhere “likes” can never reach you.

To get to that place involves failure**.** \_Daily \_failure. But it’s when you’re most uncertain
about your current experiment that you find exactly where you needed to be all along.

> Failure is a big part of success. … You’re gonna run a lot of stuff, and it’s going to go nowhere.
> And you should be happy about that. If you’re doing that, you’re doing it right. If you’re not
> failing all the time, you’re not creating a situation where you can get super lucky. … You don’t
> want to be making mediocre stuff. That’s not why anybody wants to get into this.>
