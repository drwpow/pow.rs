  <p>
    Making websites usually involves <em
      ><span style="color:#f00">C</span><span style="color:#f80">O</span><span style="color:#ff0">L</span><span style="color:#0f0">O</span><span style="color:#0ff">R</span><span style="color:#f0f">S</span>
    </em> (they’re all the rage these days!).
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll no doubt find <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl()" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HSL</a> easier to work with as a developer, since it was designed to manipulate colors more directly.
    However, just because it’s easy to edit doesn’t mean it’s a superior format. In fact, quite the opposite.
  </p>

  <h2>HSL is missing a lot more than it gives</h2>

  <p>
    Though HSL derives from sRGB, there’s not a 1:1 conversion of colors. In one sense this is obvious, because HSL’s appeal is that it’s <em>not</em> sRGB. But in another sense, just <em>how</em> different they are can often be overlooked,
    and you’d be forgiven for not realizing HSL is as bad as it is.
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>format</th>
        <th class="tac">formula</th>
        <th class="tar">values</th>
        <th class="tar">spread</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>sRGB</td>
        <td class="tac"><small>256 ^ 3</small></td>
        <td class="tar"><code>16,777,216</code></td>
        <td class="tar">100%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HSL</td>
        <td class="tac"><small>360 ✕ 100 ✕ 100</small></td>
        <td class="tar"><code>3,600,000</code></td>
        <td class="tar">22%</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    Just comparing the possible values, HSL is missing almost 80% of sRGB’s. But if throwing away 80% of colors weren’t bad enough, it’s actually worse! Not every HSL value maps to a <em>unique</em> sRGB color, and there are multiple ways to
    express the same color in HSL. For example, when saturation is <code>0</code>, HSL has 36,000 different values that generate only <code>100</code> grays. When you remove all the duplicates, HSL is missing closer to
    <b>85%</b> of sRGB’s colors (<a href="https://gist.github.com/drwpow/0fabf0cc932285ad023ca39e6f9ed35d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source</a>). And when is an 85% loss in quality ever acceptable?
  </p>

  <blockquote>When is an 85% loss in quality ever acceptable?</blockquote>

  <p>
    <i>HSL can accept decimals, though!</i> you may think. However, when you try to manage HSL values with a single decimal place, it skyrockets to 3.6 <em>billion</em>
    possible values and becomes a barren wasteland of mostly-duplicated colors. Since now most adjustments won’t end up changing the color at all, it means using HSL with decimals makes it worthless.
  </p>

  <p>So back to our original premise: when <b>storing colors,</b> HSL is a terrible format to use because it’s missing so much of the sRGB colorspace. And attempting to fill in those gaps results in mostly-useless values.</p>

  <h2>The “L” stands for “Ludicrous”</h2>

  <p>If missing colors weren’t bad enough, the colors that <em>are</em> there are widly distorted. It’s assumed that the <code>L</code> in HSL designates the lightness of a color, right? Well, in theory, yes, but in practice…</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Turns out lightness as expressed in HSL is really useless when translating from one hue to another. Compare all these values that have 50% lightness in HSL, when compared to their grayscale equivalents:</p>

  <div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:33.333% 33.333% 33.333%;height:8rem">
    <div style="background:hsl(0, 100%, 50%)"></div>
    <div style="background:hsl(60, 100%, 50%)"></div>
    <div style="background:hsl(240, 100%, 50%)"></div>
    <div style="background:rgb(135, 135, 135)"></div>
    <div style="background:rgb(237, 237, 237)"></div>
    <div style="background:rgb(82, 82, 82)"></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Not even close. Yellow is significantly brighter than the other colors! While
    <code>L</code> does have a purpose, it’s usually not what people think.
  </p>

  <h2>Use OKLCH instead</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://oklch.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OKLCH</a> is a perceptually-consistent colorspace that can be used today in all major browsers. It works exactly like HSL, except <em>it actually works</em>. The
    “LCH” part of it stands for <b>L</b>ightness, <b>C</b>hroma, and <b>H</b>ue. If you rearranged it to <i>HCL</i>, you’d realize it’s only off by one letter from <i>HSL</i>. Rather than <b>S</b>aturation, you’re dealing with <i
      ><b>C</b>hroma</i
    > which is the same basic concept, just modified to be a little more honest (some colors can achieve higher chroma than others because of the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_spaces"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer">asymmetric gamut of RGB monitors</a
    >, thus, it’s a linear scale rather than a percentage).
  </p>

  <p>
    Picking OKLCH colors is simple using online an online tool like <a href="https://oklch.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">oklch.com</a> or <a
      href="https://better-color-tools.pages.dev"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer">better-color-tools</a
    >. Using it in CSS is possible through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch">oklch()</a> function which has wide browser support as of 2023.
  </p>

  <Code
    code={`.button {
  --color: oklch(70% 0.16 240); /* 240° blue hue, 70% lightness, 0.6 chroma */

  background-color: var(--color);
  color: white;
}

/* on hover, lighten 10% via OKLAB’s algorithm */
.button:hover {
  background-color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color), 10% white);
}`}
    lang="css"
  />

  <blockquote>
    ✨ <b>Tip</b>: always use <code>in oklab</code> as the mixing space for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">color-mix()</a>, even when using OKLCH
    colors. It will outperform any other blending mode almost every time (<a href="https://better-color-tools.pages.dev/mix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">comparison</a>).
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    So again, it’s not that the <em>premise</em> of manipulating color via hue, lightness, and chroma/saturation are flawed; it’s simply that HSL’s <em>implementation</em> of it is unusable if you care about color integrity even a little bit.
    But OKLCH fits the bill.
  </p>

  <p>So please, for the love of everyone’s eyeballs, don’t use HSL.</p>
